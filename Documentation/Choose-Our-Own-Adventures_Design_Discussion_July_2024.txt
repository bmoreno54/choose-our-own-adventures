are you familiar with the choose-our-own-adventures game we're working on in another chat?
ChatGPT
Yes, I'm familiar with your 'Choose-Our-Own-Adventures' game concept. It involves players writing single sentences to continue stories, supported by an LLM agent for single-player mode. Players can browse, contribute to, and track stories, with the option to review and add comments or emojis to sentences. There are also features for tipping authors and artists, and a focus on agent-centric rather than user-centric design principles. How can I assist you with it today?

Collective Imagination:

Each player brings their unique perspective and imagination to the story, creating a rich, diverse narrative that evolves organically.
Immediate Feedback:

The ability to see how others continue the story provides immediate feedback and motivation, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.
Designing the Experience
Smooth User Interface:

Ensure the interface is intuitive and minimalistic, focusing on the writing area, comment section, and emoji sidebar.
Include keyboard shortcuts to enhance the seamlessness of the experience.
Contextual Awareness:

Display a few preceding sentences to provide context without overwhelming the player.
Highlight key elements or characters in the story to maintain continuity.
Interactive Elements:

Allow players to click on sentences to see comments and emojis, enhancing engagement without disrupting the flow of writing.
Enable a sidebar where players can leave comments and reactions to previous sentences.
Encouraging Participation:

Implement a system that highlights contributions from new or less active players to encourage wider participation.
Create prompts or challenges that inspire players to contribute creatively.
Fun Friction Points
Balancing Continuity and Innovation:

Players must balance advancing the story logically while introducing new elements, which can be both challenging and rewarding.
Introduce occasional "twist prompts" that require players to change the direction of the story in a creative way.
Diverse Writing Styles:

By focusing on these core elements and fun friction points, the collaborative storytelling experience can be designed to be engaging, inclusive, and endlessly creative. What specific aspects would you like to expand on or delve into further?

i wanna clarify something while it's early. i expect the engine to work where every story and every line is a branching nexus, and that actual branching depends on writing by players. for instance, while reading, a player can always contribute the next line or select from previous contributions for the next line. in a sense, with smart interfacing and interface customization we can thin the line between a traditional linear reading experience, a community-authored choose your own adventure experience, and a collaborative authoring experience for fluid stream crossing
ChatGPT

While players have the freedom to write anything, gentle guidance (through prompts or suggestions) can help maintain narrative quality and coherence.
Adaptive feedback systems can assist players in crafting engaging and relevant contributions.
Ensuring Narrative Continuity:

With multiple contributors, maintaining narrative continuity can be challenging but also rewarding.
Use moderation and editing tools to ensure that contributions fit within the story’s context and style.
Engagement Through Choice:

The ability to choose or write the next line keeps players engaged and invested in the story.
Highlighting the impact of their choices on the narrative can enhance this engagement.
Practical Implementation Tips
Interactive Tutorials:

Provide interactive tutorials that explain the branching mechanics and how players can contribute to the story.
Use examples to illustrate different ways players can engage with the narrative.
Customizable Notifications:

Allow players to set notifications for new contributions to stories they follow or are involved in.
Customizable notification settings can enhance player engagement without overwhelming them.
Branch Management Tools:

i like: 
1, 2

3. i really like the idea of a community-decided canon line (that might change over time).

4. allowing players to start new stories by giving llm agent the first turn

5, 6, 7

8. this suggests a note-taking system based off player linked selections (these linked notes can aggregate to a community notes pool)

9

10. this suggests story chunking where players can navigate early material by choosing between synopsis chunks to quickly get to the parts of stories they want to zoom into line by line 

11. gameplay mutators can systematically reframe storytelling without removing sentence writing agency

12. edits as a special commenting type so writers can intentionally share craft notes

+identical sentences (same sentence appending to the same story line, are collapsed with credits listed in order of submission)

13. community and algorithmic training

14. how to support this function for deeply engaged collaborative writers without cluttering core game space? maybe in-game chat that supports robust linking of story parts and support materials

15

16. experienced writers can engage in dedicated mentoring sessions where they actively collaborate back and forth with a junior writer. notes and discussion easily linked to mentoring function. writers can tag others as mentors to have their sentences highlighted or auto-followed during reading, with high confidence that mentors will write illuminatively and provide supporting comments about their craft in commenting told

17

18. elaborate emoji system to support this? what else

19. writing rooms that allow group consensus submissions with shared writing credits natively supported

20, 21, 22

23. aim to support this with community contributions, not internally generated ai art

24

25. make sure sentence construction rules allow for closing punctuation pairs after terminal punctuation

26, 27

28. curious but not convinced

29. is this the hyperlinked network notes system? 

31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36

37 this feels like an ambitious challenge to undertake as i'm inclined to believe we still want the atomic unit to be a sentence, so maybe there's something in the direction of sentences setting up future triggers for ai intervention in the story

38. this seems like a good sink for in-game currency, specifically allowing players to add progression rewards to content as a way of acknowledging the journeys taken by themselves and others
