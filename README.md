# Choose-Our-Own-Adventures

**Choose-Our-Own-Adventures** is an innovative interactive storytelling platform where players collaboratively create and explore branching narratives, one sentence at a time. Rooted in an agent-centric design philosophy, this project aims to avoid predatory game design practices and instead focus on creating an enriching experience for holistic human agents.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Story Building**: Players can browse, contribute to, and track stories collaboratively, ensuring each sentence builds on the previous one written by another player.
- **Single-Player Mode**: Supported by a small LLM agent to simulate player interactions, allowing solo players to enjoy the experience.
- **Adaptive Commenting System (ACS)**: Each sentence has a sidebar module for reviewing and adding comments without advancing the narrative. This feature fosters rich, contextual feedback and documentation.
- **Emoji Sidebar**: Each sentence accumulates its own row of emojis, while the story as a whole accumulates a column of rows. This adds a layer of engagement and expression to the collaborative writing process.
- **Paragraph Breaks**: Paragraph breaks can only be added before a new sentence and only one break is allowed, ensuring new sentence writers can easily decide to start a new paragraph but can't force a new paragraph after their sentence.
- **Keyboard-Only Control Scheme**: The initial control scheme is entirely keyboard-based, providing an immersive and comprehensive game flow.

## Principles

- **Agent-Centric Design**: We avoid leveraging psychosociological vulnerabilities to create sticky, time-consuming games. Instead, we respect the agency of our players and AI agents.
- **Ethical Interactions**: All interactions, especially those involving AI agents, are transparent and mutually beneficial.
- **Non-Predatory Practices**: We aim to design games that do not monopolize time and attention for monetization purposes.
